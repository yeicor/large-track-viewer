android:
  manifest:
    package: "com.github.yeicor.largetrackviewer"
    application:
      label: "Large Track Viewer"
    uses_permission:
      - name: "android.permission.INTERNET" # Download map tiles
      #- name: "android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"
      - name: "android.permission.MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" # Read user's track files (would be better to use a more specific permission, but this is the only one that works for all Android versions and does not require glue Java code that is hard to build)
